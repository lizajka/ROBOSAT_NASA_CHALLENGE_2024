# ROBOSAT_NASA_CHALLENGE_2025
Robosat combines SAR and optical satellite imagery with GIS data to identify forest fire zones in Switzerland. A quadruped robot, guided via joystick and GPS, maps terrain for rescue planning. We optimize routes using ROS, QGIS, and machine learning. Includes data, code, and visualization tools.
